A weather application built with HTML5, CSS3 & VueJS 2.x

At first, I explicitly exposed my API key, which is not recommanded at all, to test the GitGuardian tool, if you're not familiar with this tool, you can check this link here for detailed documentation : https://docs.gitguardian.com/

So I simply stored the API key in a .txt file, added it to the .gitignore and imported the .txt in my vue app file.
