A weather application built with HTML5, CSS3 & VueJS 2.x

At first, I explicitly exposed my API key, which is not recommanded at all, to test the GitGuardian tool, if you're not familiar with this tool or it's the first time you hear of it, you can check this link here for detailed documentation : https://docs.gitguardian.com/

So I simply stored the API key in a .txt file, added it to the .gitignore and imported the .txt in my vue app file.
It's not the best way to secure this secret data of yours but without backend solution, it might be the only way.

To appreciate the view of the app and see the changes that apply automatically after having the temperature of the city on the search bar, you will have to re-size your browser window at it's minimum width. For the height size, you can do whatever you want. I know, it's not responsive at all in this first version, the main goal of this version is to get familiar with your first steps with VueJS & getting along with some CSS code.
